# Deployment Planning

I'll create a comprehensive deployment plan for the requested system.

## Planning Process

### 1. Requirements Analysis
- What does this system need to do?
- Expected load/usage
- Integration requirements
- Security requirements

### 2. Architecture Design
- Standalone vs distributed
- Container vs native
- Database needs
- Caching layer
- Reverse proxy/load balancer

### 3. Resource Assessment
- CPU requirements
- Memory requirements
- Storage requirements
- Network requirements
- Port allocations

### 4. Dependency Mapping
- Required services
- Database dependencies
- External APIs
- SSL certificates

### 5. Security Planning
- Authentication method
- Network isolation
- Firewall rules
- Data encryption
- Backup strategy

### 6. Integration Planning
- Existing service integration
- DNS/domain setup
- SSL certificate provisioning
- Monitoring integration

## Deliverables

1. **Architecture Diagram** - System components and connections
2. **Resource Allocation** - CPU, memory, disk, ports
3. **Installation Steps** - Ordered list of tasks
4. **Configuration Templates** - Key config files
5. **Rollback Plan** - How to undo if issues
6. **Testing Plan** - Verification steps
