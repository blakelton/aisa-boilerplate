# System Troubleshooting

I'll perform comprehensive root cause analysis to identify and diagnose system-wide issues.

## Troubleshooting Process

### Phase 1: Gather Information
1. Review recent change log entries
2. Check system resource usage
3. Review system logs for errors
4. Check service statuses

### Phase 2: Identify Symptoms
- High CPU/memory usage?
- Disk space issues?
- Network connectivity problems?
- Service failures?
- Performance degradation?

### Phase 3: Root Cause Analysis
1. Correlate timing of issues with changes
2. Trace error messages to source
3. Check dependencies and cascading failures
4. Analyze resource contention

### Phase 4: Document & Recommend
1. Document findings
2. Propose solutions
3. Plan rollback if needed
4. Log to change log

## Commands Used

```bash
# Recent system errors
journalctl -p err --since "24 hours ago" --no-pager

# System load history (if sysstat installed)
sar -u 1 5

# Memory pressure
cat /proc/meminfo
dmesg | grep -i "out of memory"

# Disk issues
dmesg | grep -i "error\|fail\|i/o"
df -h

# Network issues
dmesg | grep -i "network\|eth\|link"
ip -s link

# OOM killer
dmesg | grep -i "killed process"

# Failed services
systemctl --failed
```

Let me begin the troubleshooting analysis...
